<h1>📊 Security Monitoring & Logging</h1>

<h2>📌 Overview</h2>
This project focuses on **security monitoring and logging** to detect system events, analyze network activity, and ensure file integrity. It includes **log analysis, intrusion detection, and system auditing** using Windows Event Viewer, Linux syslog, Snort, and Tripwire.

<h2>🛠 Tools & Technologies Used</h2>

- **Windows Event Viewer** – Log monitoring & security event analysis  
- **Linux syslog (rsyslog.conf)** – System log collection & analysis  
- **Snort** – Network intrusion detection & prevention system (IDS/IPS)  
- **Tripwire** – File integrity monitoring & change detection  

<h2>🔍 Key Findings & Monitoring Techniques</h2>

| Security Monitoring | Description | Implementation |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Failed Logon Detection** | Tracks unauthorized access attempts. | Analyzed **Windows Security Event Logs** and **Linux syslog logs**. |
| **Intrusion Detection (Snort)** | Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity. | Configured **Snort IDS** to detect ICMP alerts and network anomalies. |
| **File Integrity Monitoring (Tripwire)** | Detects unauthorized file changes. | Configured **Tripwire rules** and generated integrity reports. |
| **Audit Event Analysis** | Identifies security events in system logs. | Examined **Event ID 5061** for cryptographic operations. |

<h2>✅ Security Best Practices & Key Takeaways</h2>

🔹 **Log monitoring** is essential for detecting **unauthorized access attempts**.  
🔹 **Intrusion detection systems (IDS)** like Snort help identify **network threats**.  
🔹 **File integrity monitoring** ensures critical system files remain **uncompromised**.  
🔹 **Security event auditing** helps detect suspicious cryptographic operations.
